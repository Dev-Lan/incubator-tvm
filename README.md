Install
-------

Follow instructions on https://docs.tvm.ai/install/from_source.html, 
including LLVM, Python Method 1 installation, and all Python dependencies
such as ANTLR4.

Read Data
---------

For reading data,
```
import numpy as np
data = np.load('task%i.npz' % i)
x_train_configs = data['x_train_configs']
x_train = data['x_train']
y_train = data['y_train']
x_test_configs = data['x_test_configs']
x_test = data['x_test']
y_test = data['y_test']
task = data['task'][0]
```

Or for reading original unflattened data (requires TVM install):
```
import pickle
with open('task0.pkl', 'rb') as f:
    features = pickle.load(f)
```
Data is contained in `features[index].config`, `features[index].feature`, and `features[index].result`.

Apache TVM (incubating) is a compiler stack for deep learning systems. It is designed to close the gap between the
productivity-focused deep learning frameworks, and the performance- and efficiency-focused hardware backends.
TVM works with deep learning frameworks to provide end to end compilation to different backends.

Acknowledgement
---------------
We learned a lot from the following projects when building TVM.
- [Halide](https://github.com/halide/Halide): TVM uses [HalideIR](https://github.com/dmlc/HalideIR) as data structure for
  arithmetic simplification and low level lowering. We also learned and adapted some part of lowering pipeline from Halide.
- [Loopy](https://github.com/inducer/loopy): use of integer set analysis and its loop transformation primitives.
- [Theano](https://github.com/Theano/Theano): the design inspiration of symbolic scan operator for recurrence.
